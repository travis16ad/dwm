### What is dwm? Source: [their website](https://dwm.suckless.org/)
> dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.

### Why?
* Learning
  * Git
  * C
  * Patching
* Having a dynamic (instead of manual) tiling WM

### What patches
dwm is primarily configured by editing source code and applying patches, so I have some that I plan to add. I don't have a complete list yet, but I know that I want swallow, sticky, and alpha at least.
